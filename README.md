## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- pnpm
- Twitter account (for social media integration)
- API keys for:
  - Meshy.ai
  - Crossmint
  - Your chosen LLM provider

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dreamsculpt.git
cd dreamsculpt
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install  && pnpm build
```

3. Configure environment variables:

Create a `.env` file in the root directory from a copy of `.env.example`  and fill in the following:
```env
# LLM Provider Credentials
# Fill your model provider credentials here

# Meshy
MESHY_API_KEY=your_meshy_api_key

# Crossmint
CROSSMINT_API_KEY=your_crossmint_api_key

# Twitter Integration
TWITTER_USERNAME=your_twitter_username
TWITTER_PASSWORD=your_twitter_password
TWITTER_EMAIL=your_twitter_email
```

### Running DreamSculpt

1. Start the main agent:
```bash
pnpm start --character="characters/dreamsculpt.character.json"
```

2. Launch the client interface:
```bash
pnpm start:client
```

3. The Twitter integration runs immediately you start the main agent.

You can access the agent either through the chat interface at `http://localhost:5173` or through the agent Twitter handle `@DreamSculpt3D`

## üí° Example Usage

### Creating a 3D Model
```
User: Create a detailed monster mask with horns and sharp teeth, make it look realistic
DreamSculpt: I'll generate a 3D model of your monster mask...
[Generates detailed 3D model with specified characteristics]
DreamSculpt: I've generated a 3D model based on your description!
Prompt: detailed monster mask with horns and sharp teeth
Style: realistic
You can download the model here: [model_url]
```

### Minting as NFT
```
User: Mint this 3D model as an NFT and send it to user@example.com on Solana testnet
DreamSculpt: 3D Model NFT Minting Completed!
Name: 3D Monster Mask NFT
Description: A unique 3D monster mask with horns
Chain: solana
Model URL: [model_url]
Recipient: email:user@example.com:solana
Action ID: [action_id]
```

## üõ† Technical Stack

- **Framework**: Eliza Agent Framework
- **3D Generation**: Meshy.ai API
- **Blockchain**: Solana (Crossmint Staging Environment)
- **NFT Infrastructure**: Crossmint API
- **Social Integration**: Twitter API
- **Client Interface**: React.js
- **State Management**: Eliza's built-in state management
- **File Formats**: GLB (3D models)

## üèó Architecture

DreamSculpt operates through two main action handlers:
1. `TEXT_TO_3D`: Processes text descriptions into 3D models
2. `MINT_3D_NFT`: Handles NFT minting and blockchain transactions

The agent maintains conversation context and can:
- Parse complex text descriptions
- Generate appropriate 3D model parameters
- Monitor generation progress
- Handle NFT minting processes
- Manage social media interactions

## üîê Security

- Secure API key management through environment variables
- Blockchain transaction security through Crossmint
- Safe social media authentication handling

## üéØ Future Roadmap

- Support for additional blockchain networks
- Enhanced 3D model customization options
- Integration with more 3D asset marketplaces
- Advanced social media automation features
- Community feature requests and improvements
